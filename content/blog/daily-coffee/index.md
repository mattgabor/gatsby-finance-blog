So often I hear my fellow millenials talk about their obsession with their favorite hipster coffee shop. Single origin, small batch, pour over, the list goes on. Not a ☕ person? Maybe it's eating out 🥘, fro-yo🍦, vape juice 💨, or your favorite IPA 🍺.

When most people think of $5 a day - they only think about that - the money spent that day. Even if you add it all up it's only ~$1800 a year - which is _totally_ worth it for some people (☕ = ❤️). But what most milennials don't consider is the opportunity cost - or forgone interest from not having that money!

Using this handy [calculator](https://financialmentor.com/calculator/latte-factor-calculator) I got from **Financial Mentor**, I tried to mimic the typical spending habits of those around me:

Dollar amount: **\$5**  
How often?: **Daily**  
Annual ROI[^1] if invested[^2]: **4%**  
\# of years to estimate: **40**

Total \$ Spent: **\$72,960.00**  
Forgone interest earnings: **\$106,698.12**  
Real cost of expenditure: **\$179,658.12**

## **\$179,658.12** 😲🤯🤑

#### So, is that coffee worth ~\$180k over your lifetime? You tell me (in the comments)!

[^1]: ROI (Return on Investment): the amount of return on a particular investment, relative to the investment’s cost ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp))
[^2]: I'm assuming a 4% ROI here - which is totally doable via index funds, real estate investments, individual stocks, and many more investing avenues.
