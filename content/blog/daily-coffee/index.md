So often I hear my fellow millenials talk about their obsession with their favorite hipster coffee shop. Single origin, small batch, pour over, the list goes on. Not a ‚òï person? Maybe it's tacosüåÆ, fro-yoüç¶, vape juice üí®, or your favorite IPA üç∫.

When most people think of $5 a day - they only think about that - the money spent that day. Even if you add it all up it's only ~$1800 a year - which is _totally_ worth it for some people (‚òï = ‚ù§Ô∏è). But what most millennials don't consider is the opportunity cost - or forgone interest from not having that money!

Using this handy [calculator](https://financialmentor.com/calculator/latte-factor-calculator) I got from **Financial Mentor**, I tried to mimic the typical spending habits of those around me:

Dollar amount: **\$5**  
How often?: **Daily**  
Annual ROI[^1] if invested[^2]: **4%**  
\# of years to estimate: **40**

Total \$ Spent: **\$72,960.00**  
Forgone interest earnings: **\$106,698.12**  
Real cost of expenditure: **\$179,658.12**

## **\$179,658.12** üò≤ü§Øü§ë

Some of you might be thinking, but Matt - coffee is too good to give up! I totally get that, so here's a proposed alterantive that will keep you caffinated **AND** save you üí∏. Get a simple coffee maker from Amazon like this [Mr. Coffee 12-Cup - \$25](https://www.amazon.com/Mr-Coffee-12-Cup-Maker-Black/dp/B002YI2IG0/ref=sxin_3_osp43-ea9481f4_cov?ascsubtag=ea9481f4-414f-4a8c-a360-8aab61dd82e6&creativeASIN=B002YI2IG0&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osp.ea9481f4-414f-4a8c-a360-8aab61dd82e6&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_wn=osp-search&keywords=basic+coffee+maker&linkCode=oas&pd_rd_i=B002YI2IG0&pd_rd_r=9a690bfe-544d-42a7-839f-a66fe34a9994&pd_rd_w=uLKPp&pd_rd_wg=vzm7g&pf_rd_p=43ba9e17-96f5-4491-b054-e546013f7dc4&pf_rd_r=P28X6BQ3CAGDCVP3983N&qid=1560117695&s=kitchen&tag=bgr0a0-20) and buy your beans in bulk (Costco sells them for $5.50-$7 a pound). According to [coffeemakerpicks](https://coffeemakerpicks.com/cost-per-cup-of-coffee/), you can enjoy your daily cup for around 50 cents. Over 40 years - this would only add up to \$17,000 - so you can take the rest of that and save for retirement!

#### So, is that coffee shop experience worth \$100k+ over your lifetime? You tell me (in the comments)!

[^1]: ROI (Return on Investment): the amount of return on a particular investment, relative to the investment‚Äôs cost ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp))
[^2]: I'm assuming a 4% ROI here - which is totally doable via index funds, real estate investments, individual stocks, and many more investing avenues.
