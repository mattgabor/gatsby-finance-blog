This is my first post on my new blog!

My goal is to educate you on personal finance tips that I picked up along the years. These skills have allowed me to accumulate net worth and begin building a portfolio of assets with the goal of FIRE (Financial Indepdence, Retire Early)\*

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.
